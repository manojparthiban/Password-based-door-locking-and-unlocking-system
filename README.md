# Password-based-door-locking-and-unlocking-system
An embedded C project for automated password based door locking and unlocking system using LPC2148 microcontroller.

The NXP (founded by Philips) LPC2148 is an ARM7TDMI-S based high-performance 32-bit RISC Microcontroller with Thumb extensions 512KB on-chip Flash ROM with In-System Programming (ISP) and In-Application Programming (IAP).
This project aims to automate the door locking and unlocking system using the LPC2148 microcontroller, the embedded C program runs in ide named keil Uvision.
A real time simulation of the door locking system is displayed.
